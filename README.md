# Building-ChainBridge

Here are tailored answers to each of the questions in your project proposal based on recent research:

### 1. What are you planning to build during the cohort?
We plan to build **ChainBridge**, a modular framework for unified data access across Ethereum's Layer-2 networks. ChainBridge will provide a seamless way for dApps to interact with multiple Ethereum Layer-2 solutions such as zkRollups, Optimistic Rollups, and Plasma, enabling developers to easily access aggregated data and execute transactions across these networks without friction.

### 2. A one-liner summary
**ChainBridge:** Unifying access to Ethereum Layer-2 networks through a modular data access framework.

### 3. Provide a brief overview of your project
- **Domain:** Ethereum scaling and interoperability, specifically focusing on Layer-2 solutions.
- **Uniqueness:** Unlike existing solutions that focus on a single Layer-2 network, ChainBridge provides a unified interface to interact with multiple Layer-2 networks. It allows developers to seamlessly access and integrate data from Optimistic Rollups, zkRollups, and Plasma, reducing the complexity of building cross-Layer-2 dApps.
- **Stage:** Idea stage with initial design concepts. We are outlining key technical requirements and architecture needed for implementation.

### 4. Objectives and features to build during the cohort
- **Objective:** To develop a prototype of ChainBridge that integrates data access across three major Ethereum Layer-2 solutions.
- **Features:**
  - A unified API that aggregates data from different Layer-2 networks.
  - Cross-Layer-2 transaction execution capabilities.
  - A developer dashboard to monitor data flow and transaction status across networks.
  - Security features that ensure data consistency and prevent malicious actions across the bridge.

### 5. What problems does your project solve?
ChainBridge addresses the growing complexity of working with multiple Layer-2 networks. Currently, developers have to integrate each Layer-2 solution separately, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. Our project will simplify this by providing a single point of access, making it easier for developers to build scalable, multi-network dApps without dealing with individual Layer-2 integrations.

### 6. Why does this project need to exist in the ecosystem?
As Ethereum scales with diverse Layer-2 solutions, there is a pressing need for unifying access to these networks. ChainBridge will make the ecosystem more cohesive by enabling dApps to leverage the strengths of different Layer-2 technologies without complexity. Our motivation is to streamline Ethereumâ€™s modular ecosystem, reduce development overhead, and enhance user experience with faster and cheaper transactions across different networks. We envision ChainBridge becoming the backbone for multi-network dApps, driving the future of a more interconnected and efficient Ethereum.

### 7. Have you started building this? If yes, what's your progress so far? If not, how are you planning to build this out?
We are in the idea and design stage, with a focus on defining the technical architecture and identifying key integration points with existing Layer-2 networks. During the cohort, we plan to build the core API, establish initial data access protocols, and develop a proof-of-concept with basic functionality across zkRollups, Optimistic Rollups, and Plasma. Our next steps involve setting up a development environment, creating smart contracts for bridging data, and building out the backend for our modular framework.

This proposal positions ChainBridge as a much-needed innovation to unify and simplify Ethereum's Layer-2 ecosystem, making it a promising project to explore during the Avail Builder Cohort.
